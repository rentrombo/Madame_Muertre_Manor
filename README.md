# Madame_Muertre_Manor
Text Adventure Mystery Game

This is a console game that that is run directly out of the terminal in an IDE ( I used PyCharm) or out of your Command Prompt.

IF RUNNING OUT OF A IDE:
1. Download the repository zip file and extract in a directory of your choice.
2. Open in the IDE.
3. Use the terminal in the IDE to run the game

IF RUNNING OUT OF CL on WINDOWS:
1. Download the repository zip file and extract in a directory of your choice.           
2. Open the Command Prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where your .py file is located using the cd command. For example:
```
cd C:\path\to\your\directory\Madame_Muertre_Manor
```
Run the Python file:
```
python MadameMuertreManor.py
```
Ensure that Python is installed and added to your system's PATH. You can check if Python is installed and added to PATH by running python --version or python3 --version in the Command Prompt.

IF RUNNING OUT OF CL on MACOS:
1. Download the repository zip file and extract in a directory of your choice.
2. Open the Terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where your .py file is located using the cd command. For example:
```
cd /path/to/your/directory/Madame_Muertre_Manor
```
Run the Python file:
```
python3 MadameMuertreManor.py
```
If your .py file is not in the current directory, you can provide the full path to the file:
```
python3 /path/to/your/directory/MadameMuertreManor.py
```
Make sure Python is installed. You can verify if Python is installed by running python --version or python3 --version in the Terminal. If Python is not installed, you can install it using a package manager like Homebrew:
```
brew install python
```

Enjoy!
